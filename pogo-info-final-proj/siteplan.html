        <h1>Pokemon Go Basic Information</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to introduce new players of the game Pokemon Go to the basic information
            and
            mechanics of the game. This website will cover different pokeballs, different berries, throwing
            pokeballs,
            stardust, and the basic menu options!</p>

        <p>Pokemon Go can be a very intense game, especially when first starting out. There are multiple mechanics
            and
            different paths one can go down, and ultimately various ways to play. From casually catching pokemon and
            completing research, to grinding out raids, PVP (player-vs-player), and community days, there is a vast
            range of playstyles. I hope to be able to cover all of these, at least on a basic level, in this
            website.

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Here are the wireframes for this site.</p>

            <h3>Home Page</h3>
            <p>The home page of the site will have the nav bar on top, with the logo on the top left and a hamburger
                menu button on the top right. There will be an image of the Pokemon Go logo and some text welcoming the
                trainer to the site. This will be the introduction and purpose of the site.</p>
            <img src="images/pogo-info-home.webp" alt="pogo info home page" loading="lazy">

            <h3>Mobile Home Page</h3>
            <p>The mobile view of the homepage will feature a hamburger navigation menu with a button, and a footer that has
                elements layered
                on top of each other instead of next to each other. </p>
                <img src="images/pogo-info-home-mobile.webp" alt="wireframe for mobile home page" loading="lazy">

            <h3>Solo Play</h3>
            <p>For this page, there will be 4-6 differnt tiles with different titles, explaining each mechanic in
                detail. After making the wirefram, I realized it would be helpful to add a cropped screenshot between
                the header and the text outlining which part is being explained. </p>
            <img src="images/pogo-info-solo-play.webp" alt="page describing mechanics for solo play" loading="lazy">

            <h3>PVP/PVE</h3>
            <p>This page will outline the mulitplayer aspects of Pokemon Go, more commonly known as PVP (plaver verses
                player), and PVE (player verses environment). There is more of a description of Raids/Gym Battles, since
                it is easier to get into. For the PVP aspect, there is a disclaimer regarding the learning curve and
                resources needed to perform well, and then a description below. </p>
            <img src="images/pogo-info-pvp-pve.webp" alt="wireframe describing multiplayer mechanics" loading="lazy">

            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <p>This page will answer any frequently asked questions about the game as well as other information that
                would be beneficial to any and all players. The helpful links, after the wireframe was made, will be
                part of the next page instead. </p>
            <img src="images/pogo-info-faq.webp" alt="page answering frequently asked questions" loading="lazy">

            <h3>Helpful Links / Newsletter Sign-Up</h3>
            <p>As mentioned above, the helpful links will be on this page and will lead to helpful subreddits, a few top
                Poketuber's YouTube channels, and links to websites for assistance with PVP/PVE skills.</p>
