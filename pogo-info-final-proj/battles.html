                <h1>PVE (Player-vs-Environment) Battles</h1>

                <h2>Gym Battles</h2>
                <p>Gyms, as mentioned previously, are giant structures that appear across the Pokemon Go landscape. In
                    addition to having the PokeStop disc that give items, they can also be used to house Pokemon from
                    various trainers. Depending on what team you are, whether you are Instinct, Mystic, or Valor, you
                    can
                    either fight the Pokemon in the Gyms or put your own in to defend them. This is dependent on whether
                    the
                    Gym is the of the same team you are.</p>
                <p>If the gym you are at is your team's alignment, you may place a Pokemon inside it to defend it.
                    Placing
                    Pokemon in the gyms to defend them will earn you Pokecoins, which can be used in the in-game shop to
                    buy
                    items. Trainers can earn a max of 50 coins a day, and the maximum coins comes from around 8.5 hours
                    of
                    total gym defense. There is a limit of 6 pokemon allowed in each gym, but there is no limit to the
                    amount of Gyms you can place Pokemon in. </p>
                <p>However, if you are a member of an opposing team, you can battle against the Pokemon inside the gym
                    to
                    knock them out and put your own Pokemon inside. Be sure to bring powerful pokemon that are the
                    correct
                    counters to what you will be battling, for best results!</p>

                <h2>Raids</h2>
                <p>Raids are a kind of Gym Battles in Pokemon Go. There are 4 main types, each with their corresponding
                    egg
                    and star rating. They are as follows: 1-star. 3-star. 4-star(Mega Raids), and 5-star(Legendary
                    Raids).
                    1-star raids are the easiest, and 5-star legendary raids are the most difficult. Legendary raids are
                    the
                    most common ways to obtain Legendary Pokemon, which are usually very powerful Pokemon. </p>
                <p>Trainers are able to participate in raids using one of two items, daily Raid Passes or Premium Battle
                    Passes.
                    Once per day, you can receive a free raid pass from spinning the photo disc of a Gym. Additional
                    Premium
                    Battle Passes can be bought in the Pokemon Go Store with Pokecoins. Premium Battle Passes can also
                    be
                    obtained by completing certain timed and special research. </p>

            <div class="pvp">
                <h1>PVP (Player Verses Player)</h1>
                <p>Player verses Player gameplay, usually referred to as PVP, is the online battling environment where
                    you
                    can battle against other Trainers around the world to be the very best! Completion of these battles
                    will
                    earn you various rewards, including stardust, TMs (used to teach your Pokemon different attacks),
                    and
                    encounters with various pokemon. These encounters will have boosted IVs, increasing the chances of
                    perfect stat Pokemon.</p>
                <p><b>DISCLAIMER! PVP is incredibly rewarding, but tends to have a steep learning curve and requires
                        lots of
                        resources including stardust, candy, and patience. Competitive battling can be discouraging, but
                        it
                        is well worth the effort in the long run.</b></p>
