        <h2>Pokemon</h2>
        <p>The first question you may be asking is, "CJ, what is a pokemon?" Pokemon are sentient creatures that appear
            in the world around you. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, varying from apples and key fobs to
            giant dragons and firebirds. They also come in varying powers, some being extremely powerful and useful, and
            some being cute but not very useful. In Pokemon Go, once you have enough candy, you are able to evolve your
            Pokemon. This usually increases their usability and strength, and, in some cases, their coolness.</p>
        <p>In the world of Pokemon Go, the useful Pokemon are usually referred to as <b><i>meta</i></b> and are
            generally sought after more than others. There are plenty of regularly updated applications and resources
            online that outline what 'mons are considered "meta" and what aren't. </p>

                <h2>Stardust</h2>
                <img src="#" alt="stardust-example">
                <p>Stardust is one of the most valuable resources in Pokemon Go. In fact, stardust could be considered a
                    type of currency. Stardust has a variety of uses, such as increasing the CP (combat power) of your
                    Pokemon (powering up) and allowing them to learn a second charged attack. Stardust can also be used to trade
                    pokemon with your fellow trainers.</p>
                <p>Stardust can be obtained in a myriad of ways. Trainers can collect stardust by catching pokemon,
                    winning raids with other trainers, winning battles against Team GO Rocket members, and participating
                    in player-verses-player (PVP) battles. In short, stardust is very valuable, but is very easy to gather and store. </p>

                <img src="#" alt="candy-example">
                <p>Candy is another valuable resource in Pokemon Go. You can use candy in addition to stardust to power up your Pokemon and teach them secondary charged attacks. To learn about different attacks your Pokemon can learn, click <a href="multiplayer.html">here.</a>  </p>
                <p>Candy, like stardust, can be obtained from catching pokemon in the wild.</p>
