            <p>My name is Christopher Hylton, but I go by CJ. I am 22 years old. I was born in Colorado, where I
                currently live, but take classes at Brigham Young University - Idaho. My semester schedule is
                Winter/Spring, and I enjoy the classes and the campus while I am up there. I have 2 wonderful, loving
                parents, as well as a younger sister, who is 20.</p>

            <p>I spend my time doing a few things outside of school. One thing I very much enjoy doing is playing the
                game Pokemon Go, which is developed by Niantic Labs. I started playing it a little over a year ago, on
                my birthday, and since that day, I have walked around 3561km, or around 2,212 miles. It is a great
                collecting game, and I very much enjoy trying to find others to play it with me.
            </p>
            <p>My other hobby that as of recently is taking more of my time is speedcubing. I have known how to solve a
                Rubik's cube for quite a few years, but during the Spring Semester at BYU-I I learned a new method and
                breached 30 seconds, a time I had been trying to beat for quite some time. As I've practiced, I have
                seen my averages go down until now I can safely say I average 30-second solves, with my fastest ever
                recorded time 19.37 seconds.
